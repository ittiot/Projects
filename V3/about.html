        <h2> About Us&colon; </h2> 

        <p>We are a small family-owned Thai restaurant located in Kingston, WA, near the ferry terminal. We come here originally from Sequim, WA, where our 'mother' restaurant has been located for over 10 years!</p>
        
        <p>Our owner, Suree Chommuang, her son Mark Itti, and partner Tisha Lewis comprise the leadership team of our restaurant. Due to Eid's obligation to our original Sequim location, as well as her occupation as an lead R.N.P. at the Olympic Medical Center Clinic, Mark and Tisha handle the majority of Kingston operations. </p>

        <p>Shortly after opening our Kingston location in 2013 we had an unplanned surprise, the birth our son Ethan! His sister Ava followed about a year and half later, so you may be able to imagine the challenges we faced juggling both a young business as well as a very young family.</p>
        
        <p>If you have visited our restaurant before, there is a good chance you already have met Ethan and Ava! They will regularly accompany mom and/or dad to work and have even been known to share their toys with any playful customers!</p>
        
        <p>Originally, we set out to essentially duplicate our first restaurant here in Kingston. However as time has gone on we have begun to establish our own identity as a restaurant and family. Thankfully we have been able to perservere through any difficulties largely due to the support of our amazing customers!</p>
