        <h2> About Us&colon; </h2> 
        <p>Here I would normally talk about our story as a restaurant and family and how we came to be in Kingston. Instead I will talk about my experience so far creating this page.</p>
        
        <p>I originally had a little trouble with my setup, I actually wrote code for index.html, about.html, and style.css without being able to test/preview any of my work. I ended up resolving this issue, but AFTER I had written a bunch of code. I ended up having to scrap at least half of what I spent time writing.</p>

        <p>I plan to include both pages for our Menu and an Education page for any extra information relevant to our restaurant and food. I also plan to include more images of the food as well as our family throughout the site.</p>
